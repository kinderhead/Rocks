# How Old are Rocks?

A game showing couple ways of dating rocks. The player will be given a rock and must find its age. Not every rock can be dated the same way. 

## Features

* Radioactive dating
  * Counting atoms in a small sample
* Using fossils for relative dating
  * Identifying fosils from a chart
  
If I have time, there will be a cross section of an arbitrary part of the Earth's crust. You can then relativly date rocks based on exact numbers determined from other rocks.
