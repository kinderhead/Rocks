text = "This \"game\" shows 2 different ways of dating rock. One is a more accurate and precise measuerment, and the other is relative.

Radioactive or radiometric dating is basically measuring the ratio between a radioactive element and its stable daughter elements. Using the half life, or the time where half of the radioactive element becomes the stable element, the age of a rock can be determined.
This method is how scientists were able to determine the age of the earth, because the oldest rocks are about 4.5 billion years old. Using radiometric dating on asteroids gives a similar result. This is because the earth and the solar system formed around the same time, and all rocks were created then. Some rocks are re-melted and give a younger age because of the introduction of new radioactive material.

The other method is relative dating using fossils. Only two examples are given in this game, but there are thousands in the real world. If a rock contains a fossil, then it must have formed about the same time the creature was alive. It is quite simple."
